## Introduction

This repository contains a reference implementation of Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as per the [specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/). This specification is in a draft state and very much so a WIP. For the foreseeable future, a lot of the work on DWN will be split across this repo and the repo that houses the specification, which you can find [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node). The current implementation does not include all interfaces described in the DWN spec, but is enough to begin building test applications.

This project is used as a dependency by several other projects.

Proposals and issues for the specification itself should be submitted as pull requests to the [spec repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node).

## Installation

If you are interested in using DWNs and web5 in your web app, you probably want to look at web5-js, instead of this repository. Head on over here: https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js.

For advanced users wishing to use this repo directly:

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js
```

## Additional Steps

This package has dependency on [`@noble/ed25519`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519#usage) and [`@noble/secp256k1`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1#usage) v2, additional steps are needed for some environments:

- Node.js <= 18

```js
// node.js 18 and earlier,  needs globalThis.crypto polyfill
import { webcrypto } from "node:crypto";
// @ts-ignore
if (!globalThis.crypto) globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;
```

- React Native:

```js
// If you're on react native. React Native needs crypto.getRandomValues polyfill and sha512
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import { hmac } from "@noble/hashes/hmac";
import { sha256 } from "@noble/hashes/sha256";
import { sha512 } from "@noble/hashes/sha512";
ed.etc.sha512Sync = (...m) => sha512(ed.etc.concatBytes(...m));
ed.etc.sha512Async = (...m) => Promise.resolve(ed.etc.sha512Sync(...m));

secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync = (k, ...m) =>
  hmac(sha256, k, secp.etc.concatBytes(...m));
secp.etc.hmacSha256Async = (k, ...m) =>
  Promise.resolve(secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync(k, ...m));
```

## Usage

[API docs](https://tbd54566975.github.io/dwn-sdk-js/)

```ts

import { Dwn, DataStream, DidKeyResolver, Jws, RecordsWrite } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js';
import { DataStoreLevel, EventLogLevel, MessageStoreLevel } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js/stores';

const messageStore = new MessageStoreLevel();
const dataStore = new DataStoreLevel();
const eventLog = new EventLogLevel();
const dwn = await Dwn.create({ messageStore, dataStore, eventLog });

// generate a did:key DID
const didKey = await DidKeyResolver.generate();

// create some data
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const data = encoder.encode('Hello, World!');

// create a RecordsWrite message
const recordsWrite = await RecordsWrite.create({
  data,
  dataFormat: 'application/json',
  published: true,
  schema: 'yeeter/post',
  authorizationSignatureInput: Jws.createSignatureInput(didKey)
});

// get the DWN to process the RecordsWrite
const dataStream = DataStream.fromBytes(data);
const result = await dwn.processMessage(didKey.did, recordsWrite.message, dataStream);
console.log(result.status);

```

With a web wallet installed:

```javascript
const result = await window.web5.dwn.processMessage({
  method: "RecordsQuery",
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: "http://some-schema-registry.org/todo",
    },
    dateSort: "createdAscending",
  },
});
```

## Release/Build Process

The DWN JS SDK releases builds to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js). There are two build types: stable build and unstable build.

### Stable Build

This is triggered manually by:

1.  Increment `version` in `package.json` in [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) format.
2.  Merge the change into `main` branch
3.  Create a release from GitHub.

An official build with version matching the `package.json` will be published to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js).

### Unstable Build

Every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger an unstable build to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js) for developers to experiment and test.

The version string contains the date as well as the commit hash of the last change.

An example version string:

`0.0.26-unstable-2023-03-16-36ec2ce`

- `0.0.26` came from `version` in `package.json`
- `2023-03-16` indicates the date of March 16th 2023
- `36ec2ce` is the commit hash of the last change

## Some projects that use this library:

- [Web5 JS SDK](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js)
- [Example CLI](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-cli)
- [Example with a web wallet](https://github.com/TBD54566975/incubating-web5-labs/)
- [Server side aggregator](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server)
